=== Streamlit App Update Instructions ===

1. Make changes in Codespaces:
   - Edit your Python scripts, JSON files, or assets as needed.

2. Stage your changes:
   Run the following command in your Codespaces terminal:
   git add .

3. Commit your changes:
   Use a meaningful commit message describing the update:
   git commit -m "Describe your changes here"

4. Push changes to GitHub:
   Make sure to push to the branch connected to your Streamlit app (usually 'main'):
   git push origin main

5. Verify changes on GitHub:
   - Go to your GitHub repository in the browser.
   - Confirm your commit and files are updated.

6. Refresh your Streamlit Cloud app:
   - Go to https://streamlit.io/cloud and sign in.
   - Click your deployed app from the dashboard.
   - Click the three dots (⋮) menu in the top-right corner.
   - Select “Rerun” or “Restart” to pull the latest code.

7. Test the live app:
   - Check that your updates are reflected and features work correctly.

8. Manage secrets securely (if applicable):
   - Do NOT commit sensitive files like email_config.json to GitHub.
   - Use Streamlit Cloud Secrets Manager:
     * Go to your app’s Settings > Secrets.
     * Add/update environment variables like EMAIL_PASSWORD.

Optional Tips:
- Add 'email_config.json' or other sensitive files to .gitignore.
- Use clear commit messages.
- Keep secrets safe and separate from code.

For any issues, check:
- Branch you pushed to matches deployment branch.
- All files needed are committed and pushed.
- Secrets are correctly set in Streamlit Cloud.
- Manual rerun/restart in Streamlit Cloud after pushing changes.
